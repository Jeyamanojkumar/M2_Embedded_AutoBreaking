 # INTRODUCTION 
  The primary goal of the project is to save people from car accidents when they are going in a car. In this project, human animals, autos, and other items were recognised, and it will gradually apply a brake by calculating the vehicle's speed and object distance. So there are various sensors such as ultrasonic, lidar, and so on. In this case, we are employing an ultrasonic sensor, which will be more sensitive and less expensive if applied. It was a straightforward and rational approach for avoiding accidents and driving safely. It was really beneficial to both of them.
  
## RESEARCH 
Throughout the course of this project, we only used the demonstration features. Given that most automobiles are equipped with sensors, we are required to position the device in both the front and rear seats of the vehicle. Despite the fact that the ultrasonic sensor is mounted on both sides of the vehicle, the main unit, which contains the fundamental system, power supply, and other important functions, is housed in the vehicle's electronic control unit, which means that the vehicle's interior is not constrained by additional space requirements. The fact that this equipment is more practical and user-friendly than the gadget is a key benefit.

## DESCRIPTION
Based on the echo, the ultrasonic sensor "HC-SR04" generates an output signal that is proportional to the distance travelled by the ultrasonic signal. Whenever a trigger is triggered, the sensor creates an ultrasonic sound vibration and then waits for the sound vibration to return before proceeding with the rest of its operations. Depending on the parameters, such as the sound speed (220m/s) and the time necessary for the echo to reach its target, it now creates an output pulse that is proportionate to distance. This will allow us to measure distance and determine speed by adding a break to the equation.
