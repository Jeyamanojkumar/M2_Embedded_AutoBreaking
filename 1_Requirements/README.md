 # INTRODUCTION 
  The primary goal of the project is to save people from car accidents when they are going in a car. In this project, human animals, autos, and other items were recognised, and it will gradually apply a brake by calculating the vehicle's speed and object distance. So there are various sensors such as ultrasonic, lidar, and so on. In this case, we are employing an ultrasonic sensor, which will be more sensitive and less expensive if applied. It was a straightforward and rational approach for avoiding accidents and driving safely. It was really beneficial to both of them.
